# 🌸 Iris Flower Classifier

A simple machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — *Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolor*, and *Iris Virginica* — based on the size of their petals and sepals.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is built using the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It applies various machine learning classification models to predict the species of a flower based on four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (Optional)


---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Cross Validation Score (if applicable)

> ✅ All models performed exceptionally well with **100% accuracy** due to the simplicity and clean separation in the dataset.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The Iris dataset is small and built into many libraries (e.g., `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`), so no need to download it manually.

- Number of Instances: 150
- Number of Features: 4
- Number of Classes: 3
